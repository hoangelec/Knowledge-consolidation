# Metatype
Data.self presents the **type object (which is a singleton)**, Data.Type refers to the **type of that type object** 

One way to easily understand the concept of P.Type and P.self is to **view P as an object instead of a type**
Calling **P.init() is equivalent to P.self.init()**. P.init() is the shorthand syntax to _hide the singleton type object_.
